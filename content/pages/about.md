I'm a machine learning scientist in San Francisco. 

This winter I was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML) working on 
machine learning in finance. I built out a data pipeline to ingest market data 
into a Postgres database. From there we worked tuning and backtesting 
algorithms. 

# Resume 

During my time in academia I learned LaTeX -- it's great. 
Below are pdf files of my one-page resume and two-page CV;
I don't have a Microsoft Word version.

# Bio

For my master’s thesis I designed a fluid dynamics experiment that measured 
the state of the fluid using a novel computer vision system. 
Similarly, my bachelor’s work pioneered a measurement technique that 
collected data from splashes from two high-speed cameras. 
Lacking a theory to draw conclusions from my data, I developed a new theory for my analysis.

I'm currently fascinated by deep convolutional networks, Kaggle, and 
Reinforcement Learning. Applications for RL include autonomous driving,
autonomous trading, autonomous...you name it!
