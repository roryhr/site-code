Title: About

I'm a physicist proficient in the ways of data analysis, python, machine learning, 
and computer vision.

My background is in physics and mechanical engineering:
I can model physical problems,
write code to solve them, and build stuff in a machine shop.
I have the tendency to learn more than I need to.

# Long Bio

This winter I was a machine learning fellow at [Startup.ML](Startup.ML) working on
machine learning in finance.
I built a data pipeline to ingest market data and set up a platform to test trading algorithms.

For my master’s thesis I designed a fluid dynamics experiment that measured
the state of the fluid using a novel computer vision system.
Similarly, my bachelor’s work pioneered a measurement technique that
collected data from splashes from two high-speed cameras.
Lacking a theory to draw conclusions from my data, I developed a new theory for my analysis.

I'm currently fascinated by deep convolutional networks, Kaggle, and
Reinforcement Learning. Applications for RL include autonomous driving,
autonomous trading, autonomous...you name it!
