As I write more posts about what I'm working on (or finished, let's say) I'll
link to them here. I'm active on Kaggle. 

# tune2vec

I'm building an autoencoder that will find an embedding for musical tracks for a music recommendation engine.

# Kaggle

* [Statefarm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection),  [code](https://github.com/roryhr/distracted-drivers-keras).
A reinforcement learning-driven hard attention model is ideal. We'll see if I can get it going in time!

# Image Classification Networks

* I've invested time studying Convolutional Neural Networks and wrote a Keras model for replicating the results for the current (2015) state of the art [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03358)
 [Residual Network](https://github.com/roryhr/keras_resnet).


# Data Science Notebooks

* I did some data exploration for Startup.ML on Taxis in Beijing. There are
  neat graphics in the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/roryhr/taxi-trajectories/blob/master/taxi-data-notebook.ipynb)
  on my Github.

* TODO: An A/B analysis. 
And if I'm feeling motivated, a comparison of the fancy RL approach to that of classical statistics a la [Google](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2844870?hl=en&ref_topic=2844866&rd=1).
